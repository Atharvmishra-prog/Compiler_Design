# 🧠 Compiler Design Lab

This repository contains my laboratory work and practical implementations for the **Compiler Design** course.  
It covers various phases of a compiler along with hands-on programs demonstrating core concepts.

## 📌 Course Overview

Compiler Design focuses on the principles and techniques used in designing and implementing compilers.  
This lab work provides practical exposure to:

- Lexical Analysis
- Syntax Analysis
- Parsing Techniques
- Intermediate Code Generation
- Code Optimization
- Target Code Generation
- Automata & Formal Languages concepts (if included)

## 🛠️ Lab Experiments

The repository includes implementations of:

- ✅ Lexical Analyzer using C / C++
- ✅ Token Identification
- ✅ Removal of Left Recursion
- ✅ FIRST and FOLLOW computation
- ✅ Construction of Parse Trees
- ✅ Recursive Descent Parser
- ✅ Shift-Reduce Parser
- ✅ Intermediate Code Generation (Three Address Code)
- ✅ Code Optimization Techniques
- ✅ Implementation of DFA/NFA (if included)

*(Modify the list according to your actual lab programs)*
